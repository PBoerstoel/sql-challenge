# sql-challenge

I had a fairly smooth time with this challenge. One thing to note is in the erd. It is a screenshot of one I built using quickdbd: http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ 
This website is great for making erds, but one thing it can't do is include "Not null" in it. It's documentation says as much. As such while I did include "NOT NULL" when creating the tables in the schema, I was unable to make that reflect on the erd.

For the query, I went in order of the questions asked. So the first segment of code is for the first question, the second segment for the second, etc. 

For the schema I feel it is fairly self-explanatory what I am doing in it.

For one of the questions, specifically number 6, I used subqueries before realizing I found using joins instead easier for the very next question. I still left it in because it worked, even if it does look different from the rest of my answers.

Also in the challenge page a "bonus analysis" was mentioned, though I did not see any such bonus analysis.
